	// In Rust, TcpListener is a type that represents a TCP socket server that listens
	// for incoming connections. It is part of the standard library in Rust and is used
	// for creating server applications that listen for connections on a specific port and
	// IP address.TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which is one of the core
	// protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. TCP is responsible for establishing
	// and maintaining connections between network applications, ensuring reliable transmission
	// of data between them, and managing flow control and congestion control to prevent
	// network congestion and loss of data.In web development, TCP is used extensively for
	// communication between servers and clients over the internet. When a client makes a
	// request to a server, it sends the request over a TCP connection. The server receives
	// the request, processes it, and sends a response back to the client over the same TCP
	// connection. This is the basic mechanism behind HTTP, the protocol used for most web
	// traffic. TCP is also used for other web protocols such as FTP, SSH, and Telnet.
